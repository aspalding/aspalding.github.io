Throughout school I rarely struggled through assignments, oftentimes coding assignments were the ones I looked forward to and I finished them long before deadlines. On occasion my peers would ask me for assistance with a problem they were running into. Rather than simply share the code I had, I oftentimes provided some sort of documentation they could read, a tutorial or stack overflow thread, or try to explain an algorithm in broad terms vocally or through email. 

Over these past couple weeks I've been learning two languages that have been mostly foreign to me. On both occasions there were moments where I got "stuck." Some of these problems I've had no problems in expressing what exactly my problem is in a way that others can understand, but in others I feel like the responses I've gotten mean that I have not expressed myself clearly. 

So I've got another goal for my apprenticeship here at 8th Light. Make sure that I'm expressing myself clearly, and if I am not I should take a step back and figure out how to express myself more clearly! I understand that I won't always get feedback that is helpful to me individually, but simply stating the problem can bring light to what is wrong and help me investigate possible solutions.
