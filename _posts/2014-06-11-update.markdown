Going to read the last chapter of Clean Code on the train ride back home this afternoon. 

While there are dozens of neat little snippets and idea's I picked up on that I plan on writing about in greater deal, one of the cooler ideas Uncle Bob suggests is using tests as a way to learn a third party module or library. The subsection is titled Learning Tests and now I'm sort of interested in trying it myself. In the process of testing someone else's code you get a greater awareness of how it is working and what to expect while utilizing it in a project of your own. Not only do you get to confirm that the program is correct, you also get a gist of what functions may be useful for your project and how your code should interact with those functions.  

I've started my second iteration working on Ruby Tic Tac Toe. My mentor has extended the requirements of my program. Luckily I don't think any of these modifications should be incredibly hard. In accordance with Clean Code's suggestions I had already refactored my individual classes a couple times  and refactored the project as a whole just yesterday or the day before. 

In addition, I'll be reading through `Principles, Patterns, and Practices` this week.
