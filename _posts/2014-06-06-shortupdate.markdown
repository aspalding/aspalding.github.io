Today's Friday so its generally pretty hectic. 

Hopefully going to finish up my fourth version of tic tac toe over the weekend. 

Making good progress at reading through clean code, I've started noting down practices that I think are especially interesting and areas where my code falls a bit short. After I've completed the text I'll post a lengthy post (or several smaller posts talking about some of these topics).
