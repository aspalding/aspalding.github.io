Currently reading through the last couple chapters of Clean Code. Did a refactor on my Tic Tac Toe today, it's still not as good as I'd like! But it's getting better. 

This past weekend I finally decided to commit to using vim for the majority of my text editing. I already feel like I'm quite a bit faster using vim than I would be otherwise. The big advantage seems to be not having to move back and forth between the touchpad/mouse and the keyboard. I've already remembered the majority of the keystrokes I need to be proficient and I'm sure I'll pick up more as I utilize the editor. 

Anyway, relevant XKCD.
