In the past twenty four hours I've both finished and started another version of tic tac toe. This version is being programmed in Ruby. The most bizarre thing I've noticed thus far is the inability to use hyphens (-) in function names? Luckily my mentor was here to help me out, the error message seems almost unrelated, at the very least its wasn't clear. Here's the message.

`syntax error, unexpected tIDENTIFIER, expecting keyword_end`

Most of the mentions on Stack overflow had to do with missing quotations or the `end` marker. Anyway, otherwise the program's going pretty quickly. I'm already at a similar point in my development as I was a couple days into Clojure tic tac toe. Ruby is a lot more similar to the languages I'm familiar with. 

In addition I've started reading another text, [Clean Code by Robert Martin][cc] (Uncle Bob). The book explores some general guidelines towards creating code that is easy for others to pick up on, a series of case studies to exemplify how to explore a code base and how it could be amended, and concludes by listing a reference of code smells and heuristics to determine unclean code. I haven't found any smells that I'm terribly guilty of but I'm sure some of my habits will be listed. It's definitely better to be aware and know that some of your practices can be annoying or unclear to others!
