This past week I was able to get all the `cob_spec` Response suite tests to pass (most of the time). 

My server still has a couple problems however. I'm currently using static variables to save the state of the forms route used for post-get-put-get test. Every couple runs the test will fail. This problem is a result of an Java compiler optimization.

>Note: If a primitive type or a string is defined as a constant and the value is known at compile time, the compiler replaces the constant name everywhere in the code with its value. This is called a compile-time constant. If the value of the constant in the outside world changes (for example, if it is legislated that pi actually should be 3.975), you will need to recompile any classes that use this constant to get the current value. 

As a result, I will likely have to find another way to persistently store these variables. Another issue has to do with patch w/ Etag test. This test requires a file being written. Every couple times I run the test it will come up red. I still haven't quite figured out why this is happening and I believe that I may need to apply some multithreaded code strategies to fix this. At some point while developing my server the multithreaded test stopped working and I figured I needed to keep moving. It seems as if the test should pass (and it does every ~ several runs of the test). [VisualVM][VVM] shows that all my threads are ramping up and seem to be behaving correctly. The test simply claims that all the responses need to result in a 200 OK. I attempted to trace the issue but it seems as if all the requests are responding with 200 OK. 

Anyway. I'll probably reread through the Multithreading sections of Clean Code this weekend and try to figure out how I can fix these problems. Excited to see my page looking like this!
