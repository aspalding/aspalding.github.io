As my next reading assignment, I'll be reading through The Clean Coder. This text is a lot lighter than the books I've read previously while at 8th Light. The book outlines how to act and be perceived as an professional while working on software. Martin has used the failed Challenger space shuttle launch as an analogy to draw readers into the book. He elaborates that the engineers on the team insisted the launch was not ready, but upper management insisted resulting in a catastrophic failure. 

The first couple chapters of the book thus far have discussed knowing when to agree to terms and when not to agree to terms. Being direct about what is possible and what is not possible. By agreeing to an unrealistic deadline you are compromising your honestly and integrity as a professional. 

Its hard not to agree. Most of us have heard horror stories and Martin provides a few solid examples of his own. Overworking results in burn out. You should be spending time working on projects you are personally interested in and investing in your career rather than fueling every drop of your motivation and ability into meeting an unrealistic deadline. While there are probably circumstances where this is not always true and a project should be given a bit of overtime, establishing a cycle of unrealistic deadlines and expectations convinces your employer they should expect you to take on this nature of work.
