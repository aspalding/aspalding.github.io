One of my fellow residents requested the resources I used while working on my Clojure Tic Tac Toe so here's a short (probably not all inclusive) list! </br></br>

* [The Joy of Clojure][tjoc]
  * Book from our shelves that helped me understand some concepts that I wasn't familiar with.
* [Clojure Docs][cd]
  * Resource that has function explanations and input variables.
	* Also provides user examples for many functions which can be very helpful. 
* [Clojure Cheat sheet][ccs]
  * Another function/language construct resource.
	* Groups functions with the datatypes they are used with.
* [Clojure Cookbook][cook]
	* Free book that's been uploaded online. Filled with helpful examples. 
* [Are We There Yet][thereyet]
	* Speech by the creator of Clojure about some of the languages goals. 
	* Very interesting, provides some background about Clojure, highlights some more unique parts as well as goals of the language.
* [4Clojure][4c] and the [Clojure Koans][ck]
	* Small exercises to get your feet wet.
	
</br>In addition to these resources, I read through quite a bit of code that was written and uploaded to GitHub. I simply searched for the project I was working on and filtered them by language. Our fellow craftsmen have some excellent examples. Another thing you can try is reading implementations in other languages that can give you a better idea of the pieces you'll need in a language you're more familiar with.  

When I got frustrated with how something was working I tried to shift my focus towards 4Clojure and the Clojure Koans. It helped me keep working, stopped me from getting frustrated on quite a few occasions, and gave me a better understanding of the language.
