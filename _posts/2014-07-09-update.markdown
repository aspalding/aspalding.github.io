Just finished this book this morning. There is a lot of helpful advice in this text, some of which I've already blogged about. But here it goes! 

####The Zone
My last post had to do with coding in the zone! I'm really guilty of this and I think this has been one of my biggest problems yet since transitioning to my apprenticeship at 8th Light. Its just not realistic of me to expect to be in the zone everyday! I gotta start working at a more consistent, less sporadic pace and thats that! 

####Caffeine!
 Oh man I've been abusing the free caffeine. Uncle Bob suggests only having a cup or two a day to prevent hyper-focus and jitters. I'm going to try and keep this down to one or two cups of coffee in the morning and one in the afternoon if need be! I don't need a steady stream of coffee all day. 

####Estimates vs Commitments
Estimates vs Commitments. I've been treating my estimates as commitments! Which is probably a good thing, but this book helped draw the line between a commitment and an estimate. An estimate can be ambiguous, especially for the inexperienced. A commitment is putting your status on the line! Learning how to estimate correctly definitely seems like it'd help upholding commitments! 

####Bogs. Marshes. Swamps. Blind Alleys.
Uh oh. The past couple days I've been trying to add some functionality to my current assignment. One of the tasks has already surpassed my estimate! I need to start refactoring more consistently as I write code. I think avoiding the zone may help with this, as well as following TDD more religiously.  In addition using proven patterns and design techniques will help me prevent getting stuck in a swamp.
