title:  "TDD and treadmill workstations?"

Second day at 8th Light. Spent the morning practicing my bowling kata. Showed my mentor and he critiqued my work. We talked a bit about each of the three rules of Test Driven Design, what they mean, is it okay to break them sometimes?

We wound up spending a bit of time pair programming switching back and forth between writing tests and passing them, something I hadn't personally experienced before coming to 8th Light. Pair programming seems to be a good method to keep two people working on a piece of software on the same page. It gave me a better idea of how I should approach TDD. Additionally, it seems like a great way to get an understanding of another programmers style. 

One more thing. I wound up spending 10-20 minutes on the treadmill workstation. Surprisingly enough, I didn't feel any less productive while walking on the treadmill and writing code. It seems like a bit of a novelty but its definitely a cool idea. Maybe if I spend more time on there I won't wind up with a hunchback.
