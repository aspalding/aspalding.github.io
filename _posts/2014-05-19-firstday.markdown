Started off the day configuring my computer. Spent the rest of the day going through ruby koans/reading up a bit on ruby. I've started getting aquanted with Test Driven Development with a small bowling kata, plan on practicing that a couple times. Super excited to get the opportunity to improve my skills as a software developer and get a solid process down. I think I'm going to enjoy my time at [8th Light][8th]. 

Everybody was really welcoming. Seems like a great place to grow as a developer. I'm looking forward to get to know everybody!
