Yesterday I spent some time peer programming. We were working on some internal tools including Argon and Bridge, I can't wait til I can contribute a bit more! Additionally got to sit in on a IPM (Implementation Planning Meetings).

Which brings me to my next point. I've been spending quite a bit of time learning Clojure and Ruby this week. Today I spent the majority of the day today working on a Tic Tac Toe program in Clojure. Functional programming languages are something new and foreign to me so I stumbled quite a bit, but I think I am learning quite a bit in the process. It's finally starting to feel comfortable and I can't wait to become a bit more proficient using it. 

Between looking at Clojure source code and the koans I've been casually completing and scouring the documentation looking up the functions I've seen used I'm starting to get a feel for the core library. The examples provide some insight of cases where that specific function may be helpful. Writing a program from scratch can really force you to really figure out whats going on in a language. The Parentheses are feeling a lot less awkward and I'm getting a good idea of what Clojure has to offer! 

Oh yeah, and I haven't written any code without writing a test beforehand and am really trying to get my TDD methodology down. It's already making me feel more confident of the changes and additional code that I add to my program.
