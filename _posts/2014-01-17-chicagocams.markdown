Over the past couple months I have been working on an Android application that notifies users when they are about to pass one of the new speed cameras that the city of Chicago has installed over the past six months. Over the next week or so I am planning on putting the final touches on the application and launching it into the Play store. 

The application was a lot of fun to develop and I enjoyed getting into the car with a friend, testing, and creating demo videos of the application. I also thoroughly enjoyed working with Google’s API for Android. Their API seems to be incredibly complete and thorough. Their inclusive of calculating distances was especially useful for completing the application in a decent amount of time (although supposedly the function calculates a distance that is straight and not through loopy roads, which may be problematic in other cities). 

One ironic thing that had me stumped for a couple minutes. The initial data for the camera’s was found on the city of Chicago’s own website. However, their developers seem to have reversed latitude and longitude in their json files. Everybody makes mistakes and they may not have realized other developers would be paying that close attention to their data. Anyway without further ado, heres the demo.
