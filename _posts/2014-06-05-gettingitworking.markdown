This afternoon while taking my half hour away from the screen, a paragraph of Clean Code really struck a cord with me. 

Martin states "Perhaps you thought that 'getting it working' was the first order of business for a professional developer." For the past several years (starting in my sophomore year of high school) the majority of the code I've written has been read by one individual, graded once, and generally not looked at again. 

I personally prided myself in keeping my code clean (at least to my own standards) and at least consistent with the rest of the source files in the project. The goal of these assignments and exercises was generally "getting it done," and hopefully having the positive side effect of learning something and/or gaining general experience. Interestingly enough, this symptom came up just a day or two ago while my mentor reviewed my Clojure tic tac toe. Upon executing my program he immediately slammed my keyboard and hit enter. My program crashed. While I had checked the input to make sure it was actually a space on the board, I had not checked to make sure that the input was a number! Upon starting my next iteration of tic tac toe in ruby this was one of the first things I wanted to account for. 

Being able to work on production software and feel comfortable diving into a large code base is something I'm really excited about. Clean Code is already assisting me in understanding what it takes to accomplish this, encouraging me to reflect on code I've written in the past, and how any code I contribute will influence the future of that software. Simply "getting it done" isn't enough.
