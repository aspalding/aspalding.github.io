This past Saturday I gave a presentation/workshop at my local linux user group on test driven development. Overall I'd say the interest was pretty good. 

The talk started by talking about some histroy behind Test Driven Development. I discussed some benefits and some minor drawbacks that I've encoutered (don't worry, I wasn't too harsh!) LIST THEM. At this point I prompted the bowling kata to my audience. I provided a failing test and a pending test through a github repo and instructed everyone how they can install RSpec on their Linux distribution (I came prepared for this, luckily I have both debian and red hat based systems in my home!)

For the workshop element I If I had to change anything, I probably would have adapted my talk to python (as most of our members are python users!). As a result workshop element didn't work out as nicely as I would have liked and we just implemented the first couple tests and passing code together. We eventually diverged into some more general conversation, questions and answers. We talked about other testing frameworks (how can I practice this in my favorite language?). How to mock out more complex data such as database calls and HTTP responses. Some people shared frameworks they used for specific tasks (e.g frameworks focusing on REST frameworks and Standard console out!?) I felt as if I was able to field the conversation and questions pretty well!

It felt great to share something I've become incredibly fond of over the past several months. While our group is diverse, consisting of system admins, embedded, and software engineers, everyone showed great interest.
