      <p>For those who haven&#39;t got to visit yet! On the floor that is currently finished there are approximately eight side offices. Two of which are quite large. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/19/openclosed.html">Open Closed Principal</a> </br><small>19 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>OCP (Open-Closed Principal) relates to object orientated and agile design. It is defined in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445">PPP</a> as &quot;Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.&quot; OCP relates to the design smell of rigidity. During my weekly IPM yesterday, my mentor helped elaborate the concept by providing an example of where I followed the OCP and another scenario where the principal was violated. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/18/update.html">Password Strength</a> </br><small>18 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>This weekend I wound up getting into a discussion with a friend of mine about password complexity. I tend to use a long string of words, my friend seemed to believe that this wasn&#39;t a good method. According to most websites you should have a combination of lowercase, uppercase, symbols, and numbers to create a strong password. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/17/update.html">Ruby Tic Tac Toe/Blog revamp!</a> </br><small>17 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Still working on my ruby tic tac toe. Minimax has been a challenge to implement in all three of the languages I&#39;ve done this problem in so far! I think I tend to carry some baggage from my last implementation in the next version. Best practices in Java are not best practices in Clojure, likewise my Ruby program is taking a different structure than both my Java and Clojure programs. I&#39;ve learned some gotcha&#39;s in both Clojure and Ruby that I wouldn&#39;t have known otherwise. Ultimately, this should be good for me. It definitely helps to implement a program from scratch in new languages you are trying to learn rather than jumping immediately into frameworks. I know a good chunk of people that have used rails, but probably haven&#39;t used Ruby in any other contexts. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/13/womenprogramming.html">Women and Computing</a> </br><small>13 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>One of my closest friends that I met during my time at University was a woman who had recently started working towards a career shift. She was able to take advantage of a woman&#39;s outreach program and created a accessibility icon set for the Gnome Desktop Environment. The experience sparked her interest in creating software. She signed up for a Computer Science program and went on to participate in Google&#39;s Summer of Code as a programmer the next two subsequent summers. </p>

      <p>One of my fellow residents requested the resources I used while working on my Clojure Tic Tac Toe so here&#39;s a short (probably not all inclusive) list! </br></br></p>

      <p>Currently reading through the last couple chapters of Clean Code. Did a refactor on my Tic Tac Toe today, it&#39;s still not as good as I&#39;d like! But it&#39;s getting better. </p>
