      <h3><a href="/2014/07/03/javaupdates.html">Professionalism.</a> </br><small>03 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>As my next reading assignment, I&#39;ll be reading through The Clean Coder. This text is a lot lighter than the books I&#39;ve read previously while at 8th Light. The book outlines how to act and be perceived as an professional while working on software. Martin has used the failed Challenger space shuttle launch as an analogy to draw readers into the book. He elaborates that the engineers on the team insisted the launch was not ready, but upper management insisted resulting in a catastrophic failure. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/01/update.html">Java Updates.</a> </br><small>01 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Since I&#39;ve been working on my Java server I&#39;ve noticed some additions to Java that I hadn&#39;t previously been using! I started programming in Java around 2008, so new things have actually been introduced to Java since my initial experiences with the language. </p>

      <p>Defn. Looking back on or dealing with past events or situations.</p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/26/javaserver.html">On to the Java server.</a> </br><small>26 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>The next project in my apprenticeship program is the Java server. Interestingly enough, quite a few of my fellow apprentices are and have been working on this project in the recent past. So I should be able to have some solid discussion if I get stuck! Today I attempted to get started but took a step back and decided to do some more research. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/25/rspec.html">RSpec Woes and Solutions!</a> </br><small>25 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>While working on my version of Ruby tic tac toe I had difficulty figuring out how to test some functionality of my program. One case was the possibility of two or more &quot;correct&quot; moves to block an opponent from forking the board, the other was testing input output. Luckily with the help from some craftsmen at 8th Light I was able to figure out an approach to testing that functionality. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/24/workingteaching.html">Clarity</a> </br><small>24 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Throughout school I rarely struggled through assignments, oftentimes coding assignments were the ones I looked forward to and I finished them long before deadlines. On occasion my peers would ask me for assistance with a problem they were running into. Rather than simply share the code I had, I oftentimes provided some sort of documentation they could read, a tutorial or stack overflow thread, or try to explain an algorithm in broad terms vocally or through email. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/24/newoffice.html">New Office!</a> </br><small>24 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>For those who haven&#39;t got to visit yet! On the floor that is currently finished there are approximately eight side offices. Two of which are quite large. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/19/openclosed.html">Open Closed Principal</a> </br><small>19 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>OCP (Open-Closed Principal) relates to object orientated and agile design. It is defined in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445">PPP</a> as &quot;Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.&quot; OCP relates to the design smell of rigidity. During my weekly IPM yesterday, my mentor helped elaborate the concept by providing an example of where I followed the OCP and another scenario where the principal was violated. </p>
