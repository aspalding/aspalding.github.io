      <h3><a href="/2014/07/27/sshwoo.html">SSH over the internet!</a> </br><small>27 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>One of my hobbies is Linux. My home server is a Raspberry Pi running <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>. It currently hosts a local <a href="http://gitlist.org/">gitlist</a> instance over Nginx and SSH. This past week I decided to secure my SSH connection so I could open a port to the external internet. In addition to the Raspberry Pi, I have a router that has an open source linux based firmware. The router handles a variety of Dynamic DNS services. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/23/jekyllnstuff.html">Jekyll and working with the web.</a> </br><small>23 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>At the moment most of my work so far at 8th Light has been independent toy programs written from scratch. Before I came here I was spending quite a bit of time getting familiar with a variety of web frameworks. One thing I enjoyed was the massive variety of tools available. It&#39;s fun to keep up with and figure out where a specific framework excels. </p>

      <p>Piecing together a large piece of software can be a challenging task. One of the benefits of TDD is that you break your code into smaller chunks to make them easier to test individually. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/21/newoffice.html">Thoughts about our new office.</a> </br><small>21 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>I&#39;ve been spending a good chunk (2-3 days of the week) at the new office. The space is awesome. Some things I&#39;ve noticed so far. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/16/progress.html">Progress and updates!</a> </br><small>16 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>This morning I was finally able to process an entire request rather than the simply the first line. It turns out that looping through each byte and casting them as a char is an expensive operation. I debated trying to use Java&#39;s NIO non-blocking IO classes, but was able to come to a more simple solution this morning. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/15/update.html">TDD and static typed languages?</a> </br><small>15 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>When I first started learning TDD and how to write tests in general I immediately recognized how powerful the methodology would be for dynamically typed languages. A video in the Clean Coder series confirmed that TDD was a reaction to provide more safety to dynamic languages (specifically by Smalltalk coders that wanted Smalltalk to be the language of the web). After working with the methodology for some time now, I&#39;m starting to make some cool observations about some habits I&#39;d made before coming to 8th Light.</p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/14/fixingsolution.html">Fixing a problem... By removing code?</a> </br><small>14 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Today I was able to root out a bug that I&#39;d been trying to root out for a couple days. Turns out the solution was to remove several lines of code (an unnecessary set of conditionals) and to add another two lines to a separate source file. The problem I was having resulted from the code smell needless repetition. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/10/testingTestSpecific.html">Test-specific Subclassing!</a> </br><small>10 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>One of my tasks for the next week or two has been to review one of the videos from Uncle Bob&#39;s Clean Coder series and create a series of questions on the topics talked about. Luckily enough, the video I was assigned provided some useful advice for testing my current project! </p>
