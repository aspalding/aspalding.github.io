      <h3><a href="/2014/06/26/javaserver.html">On to the Java server.</a> </br><small>26 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>The next project in my apprenticeship program is the Java server. Interestingly enough, quite a few of my fellow apprentices are and have been working on this project in the recent past. So I should be able to have some solid discussion if I get stuck! Today I attempted to get started but took a step back and decided to do some more research. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/25/rspec.html">RSpec Woes and Solutions!</a> </br><small>25 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>While working on my version of Ruby tic tac toe I had difficulty figuring out how to test some functionality of my program. One case was the possibility of two or more &quot;correct&quot; moves to block an opponent from forking the board, the other was testing input output. Luckily with the help from some craftsmen at 8th Light I was able to figure out an approach to testing that functionality. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/24/workingteaching.html">Clarity</a> </br><small>24 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Throughout school I rarely struggled through assignments, oftentimes coding assignments were the ones I looked forward to and I finished them long before deadlines. On occasion my peers would ask me for assistance with a problem they were running into. Rather than simply share the code I had, I oftentimes provided some sort of documentation they could read, a tutorial or stack overflow thread, or try to explain an algorithm in broad terms vocally or through email. </p>

      <p>For those who haven&#39;t got to visit yet! On the floor that is currently finished there are approximately eight side offices. Two of which are quite large. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/19/openclosed.html">Open Closed Principal</a> </br><small>19 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>OCP (Open-Closed Principal) relates to object orientated and agile design. It is defined in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445">PPP</a> as &quot;Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.&quot; OCP relates to the design smell of rigidity. During my weekly IPM yesterday, my mentor helped elaborate the concept by providing an example of where I followed the OCP and another scenario where the principal was violated. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/18/update.html">Password Strength</a> </br><small>18 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>This weekend I wound up getting into a discussion with a friend of mine about password complexity. I tend to use a long string of words, my friend seemed to believe that this wasn&#39;t a good method. According to most websites you should have a combination of lowercase, uppercase, symbols, and numbers to create a strong password. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/17/update.html">Ruby Tic Tac Toe/Blog revamp!</a> </br><small>17 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Still working on my ruby tic tac toe. Minimax has been a challenge to implement in all three of the languages I&#39;ve done this problem in so far! I think I tend to carry some baggage from my last implementation in the next version. Best practices in Java are not best practices in Clojure, likewise my Ruby program is taking a different structure than both my Java and Clojure programs. I&#39;ve learned some gotcha&#39;s in both Clojure and Ruby that I wouldn&#39;t have known otherwise. Ultimately, this should be good for me. It definitely helps to implement a program from scratch in new languages you are trying to learn rather than jumping immediately into frameworks. I know a good chunk of people that have used rails, but probably haven&#39;t used Ruby in any other contexts. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/13/womenprogramming.html">Women and Computing</a> </br><small>13 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>One of my closest friends that I met during my time at University was a woman who had recently started working towards a career shift. She was able to take advantage of a woman&#39;s outreach program and created a accessibility icon set for the Gnome Desktop Environment. The experience sparked her interest in creating software. She signed up for a Computer Science program and went on to participate in Google&#39;s Summer of Code as a programmer the next two subsequent summers. </p>
