      <p>Currently reading through the last couple chapters of Clean Code. Did a refactor on my Tic Tac Toe today, it&#39;s still not as good as I&#39;d like! But it&#39;s getting better. </p>

      <p>This afternoon while taking my half hour away from the screen, a paragraph of Clean Code really struck a cord with me. </p>

      <p>In the past twenty four hours I&#39;ve both finished and started another version of tic tac toe. This version is being programmed in Ruby. The most bizarre thing I&#39;ve noticed thus far is the inability to use hyphens (-) in function names? Luckily my mentor was here to help me out, the error message seems almost unrelated, at the very least its wasn&#39;t clear. Here&#39;s the message.</p>

      <p>Before joining up with 8th Light I never expected I&#39;d be learning a functional programming language. Although I&#39;d heard a bit about Haskell and Scala. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d met anybody who wrote functional code besides an older friend of a friend that&#39;s a bit of an Emacs fanatic and seemed quite fond of Elisp.</p>

      <p>This past <a href="http://university.8thlight.com/">8LU</a> was my first Friday as an resident at 8th Light. The festivities on Friday put me in a good mood. Furthermore I was able to help one of our novice apprentices with a problem they were facing in their code! Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t quite satisfied with the knowledge I shared, despite finding a solution to the problem at hand.</p>

      <p>Yesterday I spent some time peer programming. We were working on some internal tools including Argon and Bridge, I can&#39;t wait til I can contribute a bit more! Additionally got to sit in on a IPM (Implementation Planning Meetings).</p>

      <p>Second day at 8th Light. Spent the morning practicing my bowling kata. Showed my mentor and he critiqued my work. We talked a bit about each of the three rules of Test Driven Design, what they mean, is it okay to break them sometimes?</p>
