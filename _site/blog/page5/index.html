      <p>Yesterday I spent some time peer programming. We were working on some internal tools including Argon and Bridge, I can&#39;t wait til I can contribute a bit more! Additionally got to sit in on a IPM (Implementation Planning Meetings).</p>

      <p>Second day at 8th Light. Spent the morning practicing my bowling kata. Showed my mentor and he critiqued my work. We talked a bit about each of the three rules of Test Driven Design, what they mean, is it okay to break them sometimes?</p>

      <p>Started off the day configuring my computer. Spent the rest of the day going through ruby koans/reading up a bit on ruby. I&#39;ve started getting aquanted with Test Driven Development with a small bowling kata, plan on practicing that a couple times. Super excited to get the opportunity to improve my skills as a software developer and get a solid process down. I think I&#39;m going to enjoy my time at <a href="http://www.8thlight.com">8th Light</a>. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/03/19/jekyll-is-pretty-cool.html">Jekyll is pretty cool!</a> </br><small>19 Mar 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Just finished putting some additional content on my blog. It&#39;s finally starting to look like a website. Anyway, for a static website generator theres some pretty cool features included in <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. For example, for my <a href="http://aspalding.github.io/work/">projects page</a> I was able to define the data in a seperate file in a directory called <code>_data</code> and then just loop through it with the liquid templating engine. It almost feels like using a database to populate the website! It&#39;s quite nice when you don&#39;t have to repeat yourself.</p>

      <p>Over the past couple months I have been working on an Android application that notifies users when they are about to pass one of the new speed cameras that the city of Chicago has installed over the past six months. Over the next week or so I am planning on putting the final touches on the application and launching it into the Play store. </p>

      <p>I&#39;ve been toying with the idea of creating a blog for some time. I am not an avid participant in social media and therefor don&#39;t have the largest social presence on the Internet. I&#39;ve toyed with quite a few frameworks and tools while toying with the idea of creating a blog. I&#39;ve decided to discuss some of the technologies I liked and have utilized for other purposes since my journey began. </p>
