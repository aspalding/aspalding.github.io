      <p>One of my closest friends that I met during my time at University was a woman who had recently started working towards a career shift. She was able to take advantage of a woman&#39;s outreach program and created a accessibility icon set for the Gnome Desktop Environment. The experience sparked her interest in creating software. She signed up for a Computer Science program and went on to participate in Google&#39;s Summer of Code as a programmer the next two subsequent summers. </p>

      <p>One of my fellow residents requested the resources I used while working on my Clojure Tic Tac Toe so here&#39;s a short (probably not all inclusive) list! </br></br></p>

      <p>Currently reading through the last couple chapters of Clean Code. Did a refactor on my Tic Tac Toe today, it&#39;s still not as good as I&#39;d like! But it&#39;s getting better. </p>

      <p>This afternoon while taking my half hour away from the screen, a paragraph of Clean Code really struck a cord with me. </p>

      <p>In the past twenty four hours I&#39;ve both finished and started another version of tic tac toe. This version is being programmed in Ruby. The most bizarre thing I&#39;ve noticed thus far is the inability to use hyphens (-) in function names? Luckily my mentor was here to help me out, the error message seems almost unrelated, at the very least its wasn&#39;t clear. Here&#39;s the message.</p>

      <p>Before joining up with 8th Light I never expected I&#39;d be learning a functional programming language. Although I&#39;d heard a bit about Haskell and Scala. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d met anybody who wrote functional code besides an older friend of a friend that&#39;s a bit of an Emacs fanatic and seemed quite fond of Elisp.</p>
