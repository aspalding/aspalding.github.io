      <h3><a href="/2014/07/21/newoffice.html">Thoughts about our new office.</a> </br><small>21 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>I&#39;ve been spending a good chunk (2-3 days of the week) at the new office. The space is awesome. Some things I&#39;ve noticed so far. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/16/progress.html">Progress and updates!</a> </br><small>16 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>This morning I was finally able to process an entire request rather than the simply the first line. It turns out that looping through each byte and casting them as a char is an expensive operation. I debated trying to use Java&#39;s NIO non-blocking IO classes, but was able to come to a more simple solution this morning. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/15/update.html">TDD and static typed languages?</a> </br><small>15 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>When I first started learning TDD and how to write tests in general I immediately recognized how powerful the methodology would be for dynamically typed languages. A video in the Clean Coder series confirmed that TDD was a reaction to provide more safety to dynamic languages (specifically by Smalltalk coders that wanted Smalltalk to be the language of the web). After working with the methodology for some time now, I&#39;m starting to make some cool observations about some habits I&#39;d made before coming to 8th Light.</p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/14/fixingsolution.html">Fixing a problem... By removing code?</a> </br><small>14 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Today I was able to root out a bug that I&#39;d been trying to root out for a couple days. Turns out the solution was to remove several lines of code (an unnecessary set of conditionals) and to add another two lines to a separate source file. The problem I was having resulted from the code smell needless repetition. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/10/testingTestSpecific.html">Test-specific Subclassing!</a> </br><small>10 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>One of my tasks for the next week or two has been to review one of the videos from Uncle Bob&#39;s Clean Coder series and create a series of questions on the topics talked about. Luckily enough, the video I was assigned provided some useful advice for testing my current project! </p>

      <p>Just finished this book this morning. There is a lot of helpful advice in this text, some of which I&#39;ve already blogged about. But here it goes! </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/08/thezone.html">Coding in the zone?</a> </br><small>08 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>While reading through Clean Coder I found an sub-chapter that really resonated with me. Martin mentions a concept called &quot;the Zone.&quot; The zone is a period of time in which you write a ton of code that seems to be of high quality; it compiles, and seems to be behaving as you intended. Realistically a lot of my most rewarding coding sessions have been while in the zone. Much to my surprise Martin suggests avoiding this period of time and puts forth some suggestions how to keep a steady pace rather than code in the zone. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/06/combperm.html">Permutations and Combinations</a> </br><small>06 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>The past Thursday one of our student apprentices was looking for a cleaner solution to generating all possible sets of a master mind game. Immediately combinations and permutations came to mind. Python provided functions to generate these sets and I quickly decided that we should search ruby docs to see if that was the case for Ruby. Of course, ruby provides four functions that operate on arrays; <code>combination(n)</code>, <code>permutation(n)</code>, <code>repeated_combination(n)</code>, and <code>repeated_permutation(n)</code>.</p>
