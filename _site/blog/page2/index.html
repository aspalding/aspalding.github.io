      <h3><a href="/2014/07/09/update.html">Clean Coder</a> </br><small>09 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Just finished this book this morning. There is a lot of helpful advice in this text, some of which I&#39;ve already blogged about. But here it goes! </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/08/thezone.html">Coding in the zone?</a> </br><small>08 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>While reading through Clean Coder I found an sub-chapter that really resonated with me. Martin mentions a concept called &quot;the Zone.&quot; The zone is a period of time in which you write a ton of code that seems to be of high quality; it compiles, and seems to be behaving as you intended. Realistically a lot of my most rewarding coding sessions have been while in the zone. Much to my surprise Martin suggests avoiding this period of time and puts forth some suggestions how to keep a steady pace rather than code in the zone. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/06/combperm.html">Permutations and Combinations</a> </br><small>06 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>The past Thursday one of our student apprentices was looking for a cleaner solution to generating all possible sets of a master mind game. Immediately combinations and permutations came to mind. Python provided functions to generate these sets and I quickly decided that we should search ruby docs to see if that was the case for Ruby. Of course, ruby provides four functions that operate on arrays; <code>combination(n)</code>, <code>permutation(n)</code>, <code>repeated_combination(n)</code>, and <code>repeated_permutation(n)</code>.</p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/03/javaupdates.html">Professionalism.</a> </br><small>03 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>As my next reading assignment, I&#39;ll be reading through The Clean Coder. This text is a lot lighter than the books I&#39;ve read previously while at 8th Light. The book outlines how to act and be perceived as an professional while working on software. Martin has used the failed Challenger space shuttle launch as an analogy to draw readers into the book. He elaborates that the engineers on the team insisted the launch was not ready, but upper management insisted resulting in a catastrophic failure. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/01/update.html">Java Updates.</a> </br><small>01 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Since I&#39;ve been working on my Java server I&#39;ve noticed some additions to Java that I hadn&#39;t previously been using! I started programming in Java around 2008, so new things have actually been introduced to Java since my initial experiences with the language. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/27/retro.html">Retrospective.</a> </br><small>27 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Defn. Looking back on or dealing with past events or situations.</p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/26/javaserver.html">On to the Java server.</a> </br><small>26 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>The next project in my apprenticeship program is the Java server. Interestingly enough, quite a few of my fellow apprentices are and have been working on this project in the recent past. So I should be able to have some solid discussion if I get stuck! Today I attempted to get started but took a step back and decided to do some more research. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/06/25/rspec.html">RSpec Woes and Solutions!</a> </br><small>25 Jun 2014</small></h3>
      <p>While working on my version of Ruby tic tac toe I had difficulty figuring out how to test some functionality of my program. One case was the possibility of two or more &quot;correct&quot; moves to block an opponent from forking the board, the other was testing input output. Luckily with the help from some craftsmen at 8th Light I was able to figure out an approach to testing that functionality. </p>
