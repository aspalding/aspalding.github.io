      <h3><a href="/2014/08/26/SimpleServer.html">Implementing custom routes on SimpleServer.</a> </br><small>26 Aug 2014</small></h3>
      <p>These past two days I&#39;ve been working towards making my JavaServer reusable. To do this I&#39;ve narrowed down the amount of routes to simply include a route that deals with files and directories. <a href="https://github.com/aspalding/SimpleServer">SimpleServer</a> can take an additional argument that allows another developer to provide their own router. Two interfaces are defined that guide the behavior of custom routes and routers. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/08/22/linuxcon.html">LinuxCon!</a> </br><small>22 Aug 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Yesterday I was able to spend a day at LinuxCon North America. I was able to to attend five workshops. Got to spend some time chatting with representatives and attendees from both large and small companies. Got lots of promotional materials. I was able to catch up with some old friends and make some new ones. Overall it was a great time and I&#39;m glad I got the opportunity to go. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/08/20/jruby.html">JRuby</a> </br><small>20 Aug 2014</small></h3>
      <p>These past couple days I&#39;ve been working on integrating my Ruby Tic Tac Toe into my JavaServer. I&#39;ve been using the JRuby programming language to accomplish this. A Ruby program is compatible with JRuby and requires little to no modification. Through JRuby Java programs can utilize Ruby classes and Ruby can utilize Java utilities. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/08/15/refact.html">Refactoring and TDD</a> </br><small>15 Aug 2014</small></h3>
      <p>This week I finally was able to get all my cob spec tests passing consistently. One thing I noticed over the span of this project is the importance of refactoring. Test driven development provides a level of confidence that allows you to, sometimes drastically, change the structure of your code. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/08/13/cobspec.html">Cob Spec.</a> </br><small>13 Aug 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Today I went ahead and modified <code>cob_spec</code> a bit. Spending about a month and a half running the suite dozens of times a day, you start to notice little improvements that could be made. I specifically chose to beef up the basic authentification test. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/08/11/multi.html">JavaServer multithreading.</a> </br><small>11 Aug 2014</small></h3>
      <p>This past week I&#39;ve been putting the finishing touches on my JavaServer. The issues remaining are mostly a matter of multithreading. In preparation I re-read through Clean Code&#39;s chapters on multithreading and the Appendix B. </p>

      <p>This past week I was able to get all the <code>cob_spec</code> Response suite tests to pass (most of the time). </p>
