      <h3><a href="/2014/08/01/maven.html">Maven!</a> </br><small>01 Aug 2014</small></h3>
      <p>My goal for this Friday was to get my Java Server managed by Maven. The purpose was to create a standard way to run the tests, build a jar, and execute my server. To get this setup I needed a <code>pom</code> and in addition I had to restructure my directory structure. Now anybody that clones my directory can simply run <code>mvn test</code> and <code>mvn package</code> to test and package the project. </p>

      <p>This past week I got the opportunity to pair with LaToya as we work alongside the London apprentices on one of Mike&#39;s Java training courses. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/27/sshwoo.html">SSH over the internet!</a> </br><small>27 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>One of my hobbies is Linux. My home server is a Raspberry Pi running <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>. It currently hosts a local <a href="http://gitlist.org/">gitlist</a> instance over Nginx and SSH. This past week I decided to secure my SSH connection so I could open a port to the external internet. In addition to the Raspberry Pi, I have a router that has an open source linux based firmware. The router handles a variety of Dynamic DNS services. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/23/jekyllnstuff.html">Jekyll and working with the web.</a> </br><small>23 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>At the moment most of my work so far at 8th Light has been independent toy programs written from scratch. Before I came here I was spending quite a bit of time getting familiar with a variety of web frameworks. One thing I enjoyed was the massive variety of tools available. It&#39;s fun to keep up with and figure out where a specific framework excels. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/07/22/update.html">Update!</a> </br><small>22 Jul 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Piecing together a large piece of software can be a challenging task. One of the benefits of TDD is that you break your code into smaller chunks to make them easier to test individually. </p>

      <p>I&#39;ve been spending a good chunk (2-3 days of the week) at the new office. The space is awesome. Some things I&#39;ve noticed so far. </p>

      <p>This morning I was finally able to process an entire request rather than the simply the first line. It turns out that looping through each byte and casting them as a char is an expensive operation. I debated trying to use Java&#39;s NIO non-blocking IO classes, but was able to come to a more simple solution this morning. </p>
