      <h3><a href="/2014/10/23/lazyclj.html">Clojure and lazy evaluation.</a> </br><small>23 Oct 2014</small></h3>
      <p>One of the preferred programming languages at my place of work is Clojure. Before coming here I&#39;d programmed in a variety of programming languages, but never in a functional programming language (or a lisp). It&#39;s definitely taken some getting used to and while I feel productive working in Clojure at this point, there are still some concepts I&#39;d like to understand a little bit better.</p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/10/09/update.html">Footprints: Retro.</a> </br><small>09 Oct 2014</small></h3>
      <p>These past few weeks I&#39;ve been working on an internal tool called footprints. This past week I&#39;ve been switching between pairing with craftsmen and introducing Dave to the footprints codebase so he can pick up where we left off. So what have I learned? </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/09/29/ci.html">Continuous Integration: Production Clone.</a> </br><small>29 Sep 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Working on footprints for the past couple weeks has definitely taught me quite a bit. I feel like I can actually say that I know git pretty well at this point. In addition I&#39;m getting a good taste of how it feels to work on &quot;legacy&quot; or least working with software that is much more mature than the work I&#39;ve put into it. I think the biggest rough spots the first couple weeks were integration problems. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/09/15/softwarecraft.html">Software Craftsmanship.</a> </br><small>15 Sep 2014</small></h3>
      <p>These past couple weeks I&#39;ve been reading through Software Craftsmanship by Pete McBreen. The books actually been really exciting, its given me a better understanding of how my mentor operates and the rationale of some of the decisions he&#39;s made in regards to my apprenticeship. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/09/09/update.html">Switching contexts.</a> </br><small>09 Sep 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Last week I expected to be working on footprints, one of our internal projects. However due to our requirements we&#39;ve had to dig into a couple other code bases. In addition to functionality that needed to be added to footprints, we had to edit the 8th Light website as well as warehouse. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/09/05/update.html">First week on footprints.</a> </br><small>05 Sep 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Last Friday I went through the first mini-review board. I was told where I am, why I should be on footprints, and some basic expectations. This is exciting! I&#39;ve been waiting to do some team based develop as opposed to solo work. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/08/29/update.html">LinuxCon and 8th Light.</a> </br><small>29 Aug 2014</small></h3>
      <p>Last week I attended a conference. I wore my 8th Light t-shirt and received dozens of comments. More than a few people were aware and interested in hearing more about our company and a few people were simply curious after sparking a conversation. </p>

      <h3><a href="/2014/08/28/MavenLoadPath.html">Maven, JRuby scripting containers, and JRuby load paths.</a> </br><small>28 Aug 2014</small></h3>
      <p>While integrating a JRuby project in a Java project managed by Maven I ran into some difficulty getting everything integrated together nicely. This was essential as I wanted my program to be reproducible by others. While this may not be the optimal solution, I struggled to find another solution to my issue and couldn&#39;t find a more optimal solution in <a href="https://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki/Jruby-Scripting-container-using-Gems-with-a-Maven-Project">JRuby&#39;s github wiki pages</a>. </p>
