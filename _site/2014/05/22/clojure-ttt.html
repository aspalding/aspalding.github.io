              <h2>Clojure Tic Tac Toe</h2>
<p class="meta">22 May 2014</p>
<p>Yesterday I spent some time peer programming. We were working on some internal tools including Argon and Bridge, I can&#39;t wait til I can contribute a bit more! Additionally got to sit in on a IPM (Implementation Planning Meetings).</p>

<p>Which brings me to my next point. I&#39;ve been spending quite a bit of time learning Clojure and Ruby this week. Today I spent the majority of the day today working on a Tic Tac Toe program in Clojure. Functional programming languages are something new and foreign to me so I stumbled quite a bit, but I think I am learning quite a bit in the process. It&#39;s finally starting to feel comfortable and I can&#39;t wait to become a bit more proficient using it. </p>

<p>Between looking at Clojure source code and the koans I&#39;ve been casually completing and scouring the documentation looking up the functions I&#39;ve seen used I&#39;m starting to get a feel for the core library. The examples provide some insight of cases where that specific function may be helpful. Writing a program from scratch can really force you to really figure out whats going on in a language. The Parentheses are feeling a lot less awkward and I&#39;m getting a good idea of what Clojure has to offer! </p>

<p>Oh yeah, and I haven&#39;t written any code without writing a test beforehand and am really trying to get my TDD methodology down. It&#39;s already making me feel more confident of the changes and additional code that I add to my program. </p>
