<p class="meta">25 May 2014</p>
<p>This past <a href="http://university.8thlight.com/">8LU</a> was my first Friday as an resident at 8th Light. The festivities on Friday put me in a good mood. Furthermore I was able to help one of our novice apprentices with a problem they were facing in their code! Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t quite satisfied with the knowledge I shared, despite finding a solution to the problem at hand.</p>

<p>To elaborate, they were working on an Tic Tac Toe problem in Ruby. She was attempting to recursively call a function thats utility was to check the validity of a move and place a piece on the board. If the move was not valid the function would simply be called again. Fair enough, this sounds like a good enough solution to the problem. I&#39;ve tried to recreate the problem in pseudocode to elaborate the issue.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">move</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">position</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">mark</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="n">redunant</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">position</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">game</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">position</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mark</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">redundant</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">position</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">valid</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">position</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">out</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">move</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">move</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">out</span><span class="p">():</span>
  <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;not valid&quot;</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">valid</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">position</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">this</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">that</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The apprentice was able to tell me her goal; to recursively call the function to request a new position if the input was not valid. I immediately decided to try and track down her base case and recursive case. Upon realizing that there was no recursive call in the body I asked where she was attempting to make her recursive call, it turned out to be in a separate function that I believe was redundant. As a result I suggested that we eliminate this function and simply relocate the conditional to the <code>move</code> function, then recursively call the function if an invalid position was given. We arrived at a solution similar to the pseudocode below:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">move</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">position</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">mark</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">valid</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">position</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">out</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">move</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">position</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">mark</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c">#recursive call</span>
  <span class="k">else</span> <span class="c">#base case</span>
    <span class="n">game</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">position</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">out</span><span class="p">():</span>
  <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;not valid&quot;</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">valid</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">position</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">this</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">that</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Nothing was lost by refactoring the redundant function, and to be honest, the <code>out</code> function could be refactored into the move function as well in my opinion. However, I do not think I made a good enough case or gave sufficient enough advice for her to understand exactly why her attempt was unsuccessful and why the revised solution worked.</p>

<p>This interaction made me realize another goal that I&#39;d like to achieve at 8th Light. To be able to express myself vocally in the domain of my career (as opposed to written advice, in which I do not struggle as much). I realize that this skill will not only help people requesting help from me, but will also enhance my own ability to express issues that I am experiencing myself.</p>
