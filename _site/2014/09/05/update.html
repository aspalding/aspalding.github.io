              <h2>First week on footprints.</h2>
<p class="meta">05 Sep 2014</p>
<p>Last Friday I went through the first mini-review board. I was told where I am, why I should be on footprints, and some basic expectations. This is exciting! I&#39;ve been waiting to do some team based develop as opposed to solo work. </p>

<p>Starting on Tuesday I paired with LaToya for a few hours. She set me up to finish the story she had been working on for the week. To finish the story, a document had to be transposed into argon formatting. This was a bit tedious, but overall not bad. After that I fixed some small bugs such as typos on the site. </p>

<p>For Thursday and this morning I worked with Aaron on modifying 8th Light dot com to only show the type of residencies available at each location. This wound up taking a bit more time than we expected but still within the timeframe of our estimations, awesome. We used ClojureScript to complete this task. Aaron had been working on a larger ClojureScript application, so he was able to provide some very valuable experience to this commit. This was also my first time to get some solid pairing in and it was a lot of fun. In addition to the TDD feedback loop, you also get live critiques and opinions as you work on functionality. I found this very helpful and resulted in cleaner code than we probably would have written left to ourselves. </p>
