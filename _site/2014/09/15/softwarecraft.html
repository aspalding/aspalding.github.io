<p class="meta">15 Sep 2014</p>
<p>These past couple weeks I&#39;ve been reading through Software Craftsmanship by Pete McBreen. The books actually been really exciting, its given me a better understanding of how my mentor operates and the rationale of some of the decisions he&#39;s made in regards to my apprenticeship. </p>

<p>A source of some of my early frustration was being told something was not right, whilst not being provided an alternative solution. McBreen states &quot;Interestingly, although apprenticed to a master, apprentices rarely, if ever, are shown how to do anything by their master.&quot; I found this statement interesting. I feel like my mentor attempts to follow this to a tee. He will provide constructive criticism towards things that could use work in my code, but rather than providing a solution, he expects me to figure it out through my own research and through the research of my peers. By pointing out that something is wrong he&#39;s providing me an opportunity to keep developing my ability to be self-sufficient and to explore alternative avenues to solving my problem. </p>

<p>Upon joining 8th Light, I wasn&#39;t quite sure what was entailed by Software Craftsmanship. While reading Software Craftsmanship earlier in my apprenticeship may have made some parts of my apprenticeship more predictable, I think the book is a bit more satisfying after going through the motions. I&#39;ll read a chunk of the book, think back, and realize why certain things were done. It brings a lot of light to the process that I&#39;ve been going through. McBreen gives me a greater sense of a appreciation for Software Craftsmanship and our shared experience of going through apprenticeship at 8th Light. Exploring what Craftsmanship really means has been really satisfying and provides insight as to what it means to identify as a Software Craftsman as opposed to an generic software engineer, developer, or programmer. </p>
