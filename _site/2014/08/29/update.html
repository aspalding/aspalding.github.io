              <h2>LinuxCon and 8th Light.</h2>
<p class="meta">29 Aug 2014</p>
<p>Last week I attended a conference. I wore my 8th Light t-shirt and received dozens of comments. More than a few people were aware and interested in hearing more about our company and a few people were simply curious after sparking a conversation. </p>

<p>Within fifteen minutes a Github employee stopped me. He had attended conferences with Uncle Bob and had met him on occasion to get drinks, dinner, etc. He didn&#39;t want to immediately assume that I was an apprentice, but I told him. He was curious what kind of work I&#39;d been doing and how I felt about the company. </p>

<p>Throughout the day different people noticed my shit and had questions about us, let me know that they had attended one of our meetups, or that they had met 8th Light employees at other meetups. One person jokingly asked if I wrote the cleanest code ever. Another mentioned they&#39;d talked to 8th Light employees at a Clojure meetup. Someone from Elasticsearch was convinced that she was supposed to have a meeting with me later in the day (I still haven&#39;t figured out who she was looking for). </p>

<p>Overall it made me feel good about my employer. It&#39;s pleasant to know that the company you spend your days at has a positive image in the eyes of the larger community. </p>
