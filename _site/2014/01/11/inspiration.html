  <h2>Inspiration.</h2>
  <p class="meta">11 Jan 2014</p>
  <p>Over my winter break I spent a couple weeks in Florida escaping the cold. While there I was able to spend some time kayaking down the St. Johns river, catching some sun at the beach, and simply enjoying some time with my immediate family and significant other. Additionally, I met an incredibly interesting and genuine person that I’d like to have a word about. </p>

<p>To briefly mention why I was so interested by this person, I’d like to mention that I’ve always been interested in not so orthodox lines of work. I feel like we often get trapped in our routines and habits and don’t enjoy our lives to the fullest for many reasons. Whether they be financial, a feeling of innate responsibilities to be who our loved ones want us to be, or we just don’t know another way. I believe most people long to live their lives a little more carefree than society allows us. </p>

<p>That being said, one day after a long walk down the beach we decided to sit down and converse with a man selling trinkets at the beach. I had previously purchased one such ornament days before and had a small conversation with the man and was blown away with how novel his method of creating art was. He collected pieces of palm trunks that had been discarded by palm trees. During the day he would carve them down with a razor blade so that they were smooth. After that he would spend many hours burning messages and imagery into the pieces of wood with a magnifying glass and the sun light. </p>

<p>Although I’d prefer not to discuss all the information the man conveyed to us about his personal life, the man lacks many of the things that I’d deem necessities. Yet he has a sense of contentment, what seems like a firm sense of right and wrong, and is very lively and personable. The man shared details about his life, why he was doing what he was doing, and how he had come to pick up his profession. The man seemed genuinely happy and seemingly had no source of income besides peddling his artwork to tourists visiting the beach. </p>

<p>After conversing with us for hours, after we had shared a bit about ourselves and heard a bit about him he sporadically wandered into some brush. After shuffling around a bit he emerged with a large self portrait of himself  burned onto a large piece of palm. It was much larger than the pieces that he was vending to the tourists visiting the beach. He could not tell us how long it had taken him but it seemed like he had simply been refining it since he had started this gig at the beach. </p>

<p>As dusk approached, the man shared some of his goals and aspirations. Currently he burns “Sun Art” and an chronological number to signify the order in which he created that specific piece. He wants to create a brand name to give himself more recognition and shared his brainstorms with us for our input. He mentioned a brand known as “Salt Life” that was created at the same beach. In addition to the art he creates at the beach, he has spent some time creating music. He has wrote and recorded three rock &amp; roll albums that are partially accessible from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8nPV5WU0jE&amp;list=UUQKrT9wHG8GO9tan-BPj5nA">YouTube</a> and is interested in finding someone to help him find his music an audience. Unfortunately, he mentioned that he has since lost his practice space and equipment. He showed us some of the inspiration for his work and remarked that he’d like to start creating more original ideas. We could sense a feeling of regret from the man as he showed us the art that he had used to create something new out of something old. Everybody needs stands on the shoulders of others while creating something. </p>

<p>After meeting Artie, I had to share his story. The night after we had conserved with him we saw a bumper sticker with the brand “Salt Life.” Ironic. Although I don’t know how much more recognition this will bring him. I personally felt the need to share his story. In my opinion, this man is inspiring and I respect him greatly for finding a way to live his life how he wants. If you wind up stumbling upon this post, keep it real Artie. </p>
