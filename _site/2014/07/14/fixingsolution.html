              <h2>Fixing a problem... By removing code?</h2>
<p class="meta">14 Jul 2014</p>
<p>Today I was able to root out a bug that I&#39;d been trying to root out for a couple days. Turns out the solution was to remove several lines of code (an unnecessary set of conditionals) and to add another two lines to a separate source file. The problem I was having resulted from the code smell needless repetition. </p>

<p>The problem had to do with serving an index.html file automatically if it existed in the current directory. I had a set of conditionals in both my Request and Response classes. I was having trouble rooting out the source of the problem and was almost positive that that both conditionals were required. On a whim I eliminated the conditional in my Request class and tested each of the individual blocks in that conditional. It seemed as if only one of them was required. </p>

<p>Duplicating the logic in each of my classes introduced needless repetition which also resulted in needless complexity in my code. A big part of agile and TDD is holding off adding more complexity before it is required. Adding that complexity resulted in a lot of confusion, I simply could not trace down where my solution was failing. By rooting out the smell I was able to come to my senses and get rid of redundant code that prevented my program from functioning correctly. </p>
