              <h2>Thoughts about our new office.</h2>
<p class="meta">21 Jul 2014</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been spending a good chunk (2-3 days of the week) at the new office. The space is awesome. Some things I&#39;ve noticed so far. </p>

<p>Since Connor and Nathan set up load balancing for the network, it seems like much of the Clear problems have been alleviated. For general browsing, it seems as if the network responds just as quickly as our old office. Larger downloads can be a problem, but if you plan ahead you can simply do that at home before coming to work. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot more space. I&#39;ve yet to have to move because someone needed a monitor nearby. This can be really disruptive while trying to get work done. I tend to try and take breaks after accomplishing something, sometimes its small, sometimes its larger. Being disturbed and having to move my workstation while doing research on a problem or while trying a solution can set me back quite a bit. The new office is better volume wise as well although this may change as more people flock over here. It seems as if most of the pairing going on is taking place in the side offices, which seems to be more conductive to working one on one. </p>

<p>The downside so far is not having everyone together in one office. I miss eating lunch with some of my coworkers that have not ventured over to the new office yet. Sometimes when I arrive in the morning theres only a couple people to shake hands with. Other than that I&#39;m quite enjoying it here. I feel less distracted and more productive. The space has a lot more natural light and better views. Can&#39;t wait for the rest of the office to get moved over! </p>
