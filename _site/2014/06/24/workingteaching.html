<p class="meta">24 Jun 2014</p>
<p>Throughout school I rarely struggled through assignments, oftentimes coding assignments were the ones I looked forward to and I finished them long before deadlines. On occasion my peers would ask me for assistance with a problem they were running into. Rather than simply share the code I had, I oftentimes provided some sort of documentation they could read, a tutorial or stack overflow thread, or try to explain an algorithm in broad terms vocally or through email. </p>

<p>Over these past couple weeks I&#39;ve been learning two languages that have been mostly foreign to me. On both occasions there were moments where I got &quot;stuck.&quot; Some of these problems I&#39;ve had no problems in expressing what exactly my problem is in a way that others can understand, but in others I feel like the responses I&#39;ve gotten mean that I have not expressed myself clearly. </p>

<p>So I&#39;ve got another goal for my apprenticeship here at 8th Light. Make sure that I&#39;m expressing myself clearly, and if I am not I should take a step back and figure out how to express myself more clearly! I understand that I won&#39;t always get feedback that is helpful to me individually, but simply stating the problem can bring light to what is wrong and help me investigate possible solutions. </p>
