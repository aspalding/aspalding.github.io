              <h2>Ruby Tic Tac Toe/Blog revamp!</h2>
<p class="meta">17 Jun 2014</p>
<p>Still working on my ruby tic tac toe. Minimax has been a challenge to implement in all three of the languages I&#39;ve done this problem in so far! I think I tend to carry some baggage from my last implementation in the next version. Best practices in Java are not best practices in Clojure, likewise my Ruby program is taking a different structure than both my Java and Clojure programs. I&#39;ve learned some gotcha&#39;s in both Clojure and Ruby that I wouldn&#39;t have known otherwise. Ultimately, this should be good for me. It definitely helps to implement a program from scratch in new languages you are trying to learn rather than jumping immediately into frameworks. I know a good chunk of people that have used rails, but probably haven&#39;t used Ruby in any other contexts. </p>

<p>Also! I&#39;ve reworked the HTML and CSS for my blog a bit. I wanted to implement what Nick <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/nick-meccia/2013/08/23/designing-irrationally.html">discussed</a> during his keynote last week. Anyway, I like how it turned out and did some additional tweaks as well where I saw fit. </p>

<p>Currently reading through PPP. I&#39;m feeling a bit guilty. I think I might violate some of these principals somewhat frequently. However, I&#39;m trying to read this one pretty thoroughly so that I can identify these smells as I write them and refactor them out of my code earlier than later! </p>
