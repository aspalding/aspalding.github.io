              <h2>Women and Computing</h2>
<p class="meta">13 Jun 2014</p>
<p>One of my closest friends that I met during my time at University was a woman who had recently started working towards a career shift. She was able to take advantage of a woman&#39;s outreach program and created a accessibility icon set for the Gnome Desktop Environment. The experience sparked her interest in creating software. She signed up for a Computer Science program and went on to participate in Google&#39;s Summer of Code as a programmer the next two subsequent summers. </p>

<p>I believe the biggest barrier towards getting women involved in programming is getting them interested and involved. I took classes for Computer Science throughout high school and college. The ratio of women to men was much lower than 8th Light. Most of my courses had less than 5 women, some of my smaller classes had no women at all (ex Theory Of Computation). Its hard to understand why exactly this is the case. I do not believe men are innately more well suited for programming than women. </p>

<p>To be honest, I don&#39;t know if this argument is about men and women, but rather about the background of individuals. I do not believe that women are not capable of picking up the skills required to program. Computing has become more accessible as a whole in the past decades. Not just for men or women. Languages becoming more high level allows a broader range of people in general to participate regardless of gender.</p>

<p>Women are misrepresented in many trade and &quot;maker&quot; jobs. Change takes a long time. As a company that promotes craftsmanship, we have a unique opportunity to contribute towards that positive change. Women have just as much to contribute towards our field as men. Women as individuals can make our team more well rounded and they will bring their unique experiences into our work place. Change takes time, but by being part of that change we can make a difference sooner rather than later. </p>
