<p class="meta">03 Jun 2014</p>
<p>Before joining up with 8th Light I never expected I&#39;d be learning a functional programming language. Although I&#39;d heard a bit about Haskell and Scala. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d met anybody who wrote functional code besides an older friend of a friend that&#39;s a bit of an Emacs fanatic and seemed quite fond of Elisp.</p>

<p>This past week and a half I&#39;ve been working on an Tic Tac Toe implementation in Clojure. The experience has been sort of jarring to say the least. TDD helped me get through the low hanging fruit of the program in a reasonable period of time, regardless of the code not being the most idiomatic Clojure code ever written. However, the intelligent AI and run-time loop put me into a bit of a bind. I still don&#39;t have any tests written for the run-time loop. Fortunately I think I&#39;ve figured out how to test my intelligent algorithm.</p>

<p>One of my biggest challenges has been figuring out what to use as a resource. I&#39;ve gone through the majority of the Clojure Koans, read the documentation on at least a hundred core library Clojure functions, looked at and attempted to trace dozens of implementations of the program I&#39;m working on, started working through 4clojure problems, watched a presentation by Rich Hickey, read dozens of blog articles about Clojure, read through about half of <a href="http://joyofclojure.com/">The Joy Of Clojure</a>, even read blog posts about intelligent tic tac toe programs being implemented in other functional programming languages. I have an idea of what Clojure has to offer, but writing the code still feels awkward. </p>

<p>Regardless, here I am. I&#39;ve been grinding my gears this past week. Writing a program from scratch in a new language is always challenging but that&#39;s why I&#39;m here in the first place! So I gotta buckle down and appreciate my opportunity to work with all the cool people at 8th Light.</p>
