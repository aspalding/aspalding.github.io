              <h2>Retrospective.</h2>
<p class="meta">27 Jun 2014</p>
<p>Defn. Looking back on or dealing with past events or situations.</p>

<p>This week I had my first retrospective. I had not heard of a retrospective until my mentor mentioned that we&#39;d be having one after my IPM (That I knew about). Basically one of our co workers joined us after our weekly iterative planning meeting. He facilitated a discussion about how my apprenticeship was going, how my mentor is doing, and how I am doing.</p>

<p>Me and my mentor both agreed that we needed some additional communication. Myles didn&#39;t come down too hard on me and the meeting was pretty positive. We got to discuss some things I&#39;m interested in doing before the end of my apprenticeship.</p>

<p>The formalized meeting also made me reflect a little personally as well. The experience so far has been a bit humbling. I can&#39;t wait to get started on bigger things, but I understand that its going to take some more preparation. My various versions of tic tac toe got me familiar with TDD. Now I&#39;ve got a larger project where I&#39;ll try to implement a clean object oriented design and try to conform to the SOLID principles. </p>

<p>I&#39;m appreciating my time here at 8th Light and I&#39;m glad to have the opportunity to keep learning! </p>
